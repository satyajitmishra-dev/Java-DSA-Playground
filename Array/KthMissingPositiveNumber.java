++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  QUESTION & EXAMPLE  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Given a sorted array of distinct positive integers arr[], we need to find the kth positive number that is missing from arr[].  

Examples :
Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 4, 7, 11], k = 5
Output: 9
Explanation: Missing are 1, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10‚Ä¶ and 5th missing number is 9.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  APPROACH ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The input array is sorted, once we have found the index i such that arr[i] > (k + i), then for all indices j (j > i), arr[j] will also be greater than (k + j). So, we can optimize the previous approach using binary search to find the index i so that the k-th missing element is k + i.
