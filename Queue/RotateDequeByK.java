// Problem Statement : Rotate Deque By K (GFG, Easy)

You are given a deque dq (double-ended queue) containing non-negative integers, along with two positive integer type and k. The task is to rotate the deque circularly by k positions.
There are two types of rotation operations:


Right Rotation (Clockwise): If type = 1, rotate the deque to the right. This means moving the last element to the front, and repeating the process k times.

Left Rotation (Anti-Clockwise): If type = 2, rotate the deque to the left. This means moving the first element to the back, and repeating the process k times.

Examples:

Input: dq = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], type = 1, k = 2
Output: [5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4] 
Explanation: The type is 1 and k is 2. So, we need to right rotate dequeue by 2 times.

In first right rotation we get [6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
In second right rotation we get [5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4].
Input: dq = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], type = 2, k = 3 
Output: [40, 50, 10, 20, 30] 
Explanation: The type is 2 and k is 3. So, we need to left rotate dequeue by 3 times.

In first left rotation we get [20, 30, 40, 50, 10]. 
In second left rotation we get [30, 40, 50, 10, 20].
In third left rotation we get [40, 50, 10, 20, 30].
Constraints:
1 ‚â§ dq.size() ‚â§ 105 
1 ‚â§ k ‚â§ 105 
1 ‚â§ type ‚â§ 2

The idea if the type is 1 (right rotation), we repeatedly take the last element of the deque and move it to the front, doing this process k times. If the type is 2 (left rotation), we repeatedly take the first element and move it to the back, again k times. When k > n (where n is the size of the deque), performing k rotations is unnecessary because every n rotations bring the deque back to its original state. Therefore, we only need to rotate k % n times.

        // Use modulo to avoid unnecessary full rotations
        k = k % n;
        
         // Right rotation
        if (type == 1) { 
            for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
                int val = dq.removeLast();
                dq.addFirst(val);
            }
            
            // Left rotation
        } else if (type == 2) { 
            for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
                int val = dq.removeFirst();
                dq.addLast(val);
