// Problem Statement : Find length of Loop (GFG  , Medium)


// # This is very important question For your interview

Given the head of a linked list, determine whether the list contains a loop. If a loop is present, return the number of nodes in the loop, otherwise return 0.

Note: Internally, pos(1 based index) is used to denote the position of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. If pos = 0, it means the last node points to null, indicating there is no loop. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Examples:

Input: pos = 2,
   
Output: 4
Explanation: There exists a loop in the linked list and the length of the loop is 4.
Input: pos = 3,
   
Output: 3
Explanation: The loop is from 19 to 10. So length of loop is 19 ‚Üí 33 ‚Üí 10 = 3.
Input: pos = 0,
    
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no loop.
Constraints:
1 ‚â§ number of nodes ‚â§ 105
1 ‚â§ node->data ‚â§ 104
0 ‚â§ pos < number of nodes

 Using Floyd‚Äôs Cycle Detection Algorithm - O(n) Time and O(1) Space

The idea is to use Floyd‚Äôs Cycle detection algorithm for detecting the common point in the loop. Using fast and slow pointer

Step by Step Approach:

Use a fast and slow pointer pointing to head of linked list.
move fast pointer to fast->next->next and slow pointer to slow->next.
If a common meeting point exists between the slow and fast pointers, it confirms the presence of a loop.
Once the loop is detected, we start counting the number of nodes in the loop by initializing a counter and traversing the loop starting from the meeting point.
If no meeting point is found, it means there is no loop, so we return 0.
